      <h1>Welcome to Open Door</h1>
      <p>You are not alone.</p>
      <p>
        Open Door is a safe, anonymous place to share your thoughts, struggles,
        victories, and hopes.
      </p>
      <p>No accounts. No judgment. Just presence.</p>
      <p>Here, your voice matters â€” even when words are hard to find.</p>
      <p>
        Someone out there might read what you share, and feel a little less
        alone too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open Door exists to remind us all: Every voice deserves to be heard.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for being here. ðŸŒ¿</p>
